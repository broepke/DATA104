# Project Description

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. Create a new R Markdown/Notebook from *File | New File | R Notebook* in the tool bar.

Execute code chunks by clicking the *Run* button (arrow) within the chunk. Execute all chunks via the *Run* menu in the tool bar.

Export/Knit to HTML: click the *Preview | Knit to HTML* to generate an HTML file. The file name is automatically generated as: <ProjectName.html


```{r}
# this is one code chunk. 
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert R* button on the toolbar or simplying copying a chuck specified by ```{r} (beggining) and ``` (end)

Throughout, you should be documenting your analysis using markdown. Refer to the *R Markdown Cheat Sheet* under Resources section at the top of E-Learning. Markdown is anything outside code chunks. Following are some basics.

# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3

**bold**

*italics*

* unordered list item 1
* unordered list item 2

## Project setup

```{r}
# Another chunk with more R code

# clear all objects includes hidden objects from Global Environment
rm(list = ls(all.names = TRUE)) 

# set working dir if desired so you don't need to specify file path
#setwd("~/Desktop/GGU/data 104/data")
```

# Executive Summary

In 2006 Elon Musk wrote a blog post titled, [The Secret Tesla Motors Master Plan (just between you and me)](https://www.tesla.com/blog/secret-tesla-motors-master-plan-just-between-you-and-me), where he detailed out the strategy for the company.  In this post, he offered up a multi-step plan to achieve the [mission](https://www.tesla.com/about) slated by the company:

*Tesla's mission is to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy.*

The plan detailed four steps that would eventually lead to what is known as the Tesla Model 3, the first affordable, high-performance, no-compromise electric car.  As of March 2020, the model 3 became the all-time best selling plug-in electric car surpassing the Nissan LEAF, and it accomplished this in just 2.5 years, versus ten years for the LEAF[^BEST].

As the plan noted, the goal was to build a more affordable car accessible to more people than the previous premium market products.  The Model 3 was launched with a $35,000 price point making it competitive with entry-level German vehicles.  It was met with an incredible reception garnering 200,000 pre-orders in the first 24 hours after it's launch[^LAUNCH]. It's since sold 500,000 units and continues to be loved.

However, while the company is doing fantastic, its stock at all-time highs and soon entering the S&P 500[^SP] has seen its share of Quality issues.  In June of 2020, J.D. Power released its annual quality study showing that Tesla was ranked last among 32 automotive brands[^JD].  Bloomberg performed a survey of 5,000 Model 3 owners published in October of 2019, where owners submitted details of their quality issues [^BLOOM].  Owners stated that the most significant problems were with paint and panel gaps.  While the report found that cars' defects cut in half over time, Tesla is still working to optimize its production.  

This report will look at user's discussions, mostly in 2020, from the [Tesla Model 3 Discussion Forums](https://forums.tesla.com/categories/tesla-model-3) to surface what is top of mind and what issues might still be effecting the Model 3.  The forums are an open place where people can post topics, ask questions, or generally participate in the community.  User forums are rich with information that can give an alternative view into customer sentiment, unlike Social Media or traditional Surveys. 


The plan's four-step master plan:

1. Build sports car
2. Use that money to build an affordable car
3. Use that money to build an even more affordable car
4. While doing above, also provide zero emission electric power generation options

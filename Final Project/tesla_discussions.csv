Model 3 RWD stucked in 1 inch of snow,"Had 1 inch of densely packed snow in the driveway 2 weeks ago during a snownstorm and the Model 3 wouldn’t budge. Shoveled to the tarmac and then it could go up the slight incline. RWD car backing a slight snowy incline from a standstill 90 degrees perpendicular parking on a heavy car is really the worse case scenario. With no momentum it’s impossible to move the weight of the car with the rear wheels engaging first so the preferable way of parking is front first however the charging port in the back does not make this optimal.

I believe that Tesla went with RWD in the single motor cars because of the transfer of the car’s weight to the rear wheels on acceleration.

Audio Commands - What can you do with the Model 3?,"With a lot of people complaining about accessing sub menus on center console while driving, just curious to see how people feel about the audio command functionality (I heard that you can do this). One simple fix to the center console perceived problem would be to allow you to access most functionality by simply telling the car to do something. With that in mind, here are my questions1. How do you access the audio commands on the car (is it like Google assistant where you say ""Ok Google"")?2. What command functions can be accessed with audio commands (AP, AC temp, GPS, Radio, etc.)? Can you give obscure commands like ""Open Glove box"" or ""Set speed to 75mph""?)3. How well does the car understand the commands and how often does the command fail?4. Does Tesla improve audio commands with each update?Thanks for your thoughts.

1. You press the right scroll wheel to get into voice mode, after it beeps you can just say your command.
2. Here's a thread over on TMC that lists what people know it can do. https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/threads/known-working-voice-commands.112136/
3. No idea, but I haven't heard many complaints over it.
4. Probably not with ""each"" update, but Elon has stated that eventually he wants all functions to be able to be controlled by voice.",dsvick_98030126,September 2018
Audio Commands - What can you do with the Model 3?,"1. In addition to the right scroll wheel button, you can tap the microphone on the touchscreen
2. See above
3. I've only owned it a week, and have only used voice commands a few times, but it seems to be just as good (or bad) as you experience with Google or Apple voice recognition. It is actually pretty good and does a good job of extrapolating meaning and correcting for what it thinks you mean. Only once did I have any issue. I asked to navigate to an address on Ben Payne Road,"" and it searched for ""Benton Road."" Otherwise, all of my other commands it has understood perfectly.
4. As mentioned above, I highly doubt *every* update does improvements to this, but I have seen people mention in the forums that voice recognition has improved over time.",shadoh_98228408,September 2018
Audio Commands - What can you do with the Model 3?,"Thanks for the responses. Yea... ""simple"" was probably not the right word but I would imagine that with a lot of functionality being software based, it would be easier for Tesla to incorporate wider voice commands than other manufacturers.
So the take away from the link is that voice commands essentially allows to access GPS functions and Music. I can see 2 other voice commands that I think could be important from a safety perspective
1. Controlling Wiper Speed
2. Setting headlights to high-low
In each of these cases, I can see a safety advantage to allowing someone to control these things verbally while driving without having to hit certain buttons on the screen. I know you can set these things to auto but I have heard anecdotal reports from a friend who owns the Model 3 that the auto setting doesnt always do what he wants (i.e. diriving and then getting hit with a flash torrential rain storm and the auto wipers not going to ""fast"" setting quick enough)
Maybe these can be implemented in future updates.",Gpuszkin_98035908,September 2018
Audio Commands - What can you do with the Model 3?,Voice control for infotainment system is easier. It's harder for car function related comments because of safety issues. It has to be 100% right. As for head light high low control it is done automatically if you have PUP.,Unknown,September 2018

I totally agree with this idea. I don't yet own a Model 3, but I own a Volvo that relies heavily on a touch screen user interface. Volvo didn't eliminate physical buttons as much as Model 3 did, but close. In my two years of driving the Volvo, I like the approach of eliminating physical buttons. But it does have a drawback of having to look away from the road to control things while driving. Having the ability to do all screen commands/settings via voice would be greatly useful to me.
I had read a Musk tweet a while ago that Tesla intends to do that. I hope it happens. I think it will be a great safety and convenience feature.",lumberjack,September 2018

My daughter has a somewhat unusual name which has made it impossible for me to call her via voice command because the system can't pick her name out in my contacts. I wish I could type the name and say it to teach the car for future reference.
Another miss that surprised me was when I asked to navigate to the supercharger in Bourne, MA. Bourne is pronounced 'born', but there is no Born, MA. The nav system could not find it. I would think that simply limiting the search to superchargers within a 200 mi radius should have made this a simple match to make.",josh.cochin_98167660,January 2019

Having to look away from the road to do simple things undermines the safety promise of these cars. I also would much rather not mediate every aspect of life through a screen, I already do that most of the day  It looks like a cool space ship to eliminate everything analog, but doesn't function all that well. If they had voice commands for many functions and required a yes or no voice confirmation that would seem helpful. Of course there may be safety-related functions of the car (obviously braking, steering, acceleration, etc) that wouldn't be done by voice command, but it seems like only a safety-upside to get the vast majority of functions operating by voice.Having said that, dialing in all the nuances of human language is a challenge for all the big players in voice recognition. It's ok if it doesn't always get my favorite songs right so long as I don't have to look down at the screen.

40%?",WW_icefree,December 7

You may be conflating battery heating. The seat consumption seems higher than reported elsewhere , but 7 kW is higher for cabin heat than the Model S. Less than 5kW is what’s been reported.

Nope, not conflating anything...we've had this discussion before.
Your video was not max heat. That was a set point of 72 F, maybe the fax was maxed but that is I think around 400W for the fax maxed.
To re-post my data here, at 55F outside temp(your video showed 52F), maintenance draw for 80F was about 3kW...I could see the car not maxing out the heater to go from 52 to 72F but that is just an assumption on my part. The other more important data point is from my previous post here https://forums.tesla.com/discussion/168807/temps-precondition-regen-data-with-graphs/ In this post I also link to a graph here https://imgur.com/a/rPYkW0a that shows Battery power vs time. In the OP explanation, this was me setting the HVAC to Auto and HI. Data was from the CANBus via an OBDII adapter and ScanMyTeslaApp. Graph shows the Battery power maxing out at 7-7.5kW.

"22"" Rims for Model 3","21"" or 22"" wheels would really decrease the efficiency of the car. It would take a lot more electric charging. You'd need lower profile tires on those 21"" or 22"" wheels (otherwise the wheel won't fit in the wheel well) to maintain acceptable overall wheel diameter. Putting 22-inch rims on with no modifications will cause the car's body to hit the tires when driving over bumps and can cause the front tires to rub on the fenders when making a turn. Low-profile tires means there's less rubber between the rim and the road, and you're more likely to get wheel damage if you hit a pothole. Your 0-60 acceleration time will be much worse too.",in7_98388832,2:59AM

Nope I read it. Volkswagon sold 10475 cars in September and October and reported all the sales in October. I am curios how many were pre-sales. Let’s see, Tesla sold 16125 cars in September and 900 in October. I guess because Volkswagon reported all their sales in October they win over Tesla’s 900 in October.
And what does Forbes say about the ID.3 vs Tesla?
“It is well known on The Street that Tesla manages their business based on quarterly results , and everyone knows Elon and co. maximize quarterly deliveries by gearing up the Tesla marketing machine in the last month of any given quarter. This is obvious. “
So yes 2 months of ID.3 sales beat Tesla’s October sales. But all ID.3 sales to date have not surpassed Tesla M3 sales for the same time period.

Nope I read it. Volkswagon sold 10475 cars in September and October and reported all the sales in October. I am curios how many were pre-sales. Let’s see, Tesla sold 16125 cars in September and 900 in October. I guess because Volkswagon reported all their sales in October they win over Tesla’s 900 in October.
And what does Forbes say about the ID.3 vs Tesla?
“It is well known on The Street that Tesla manages their business based on quarterly results , and everyone knows Elon and co. maximize quarterly deliveries by gearing up the Tesla marketing machine in the last month of any given quarter. This is obvious. “
So yes 2 months of ID.3 sales beat Tesla’s October sales. But all ID.3 sales to date have not surpassed Tesla M3 sales for the same time period. 
And shortly the refreshed M3 and Model Y will arrive in Europe which is likely what most folks are waiting for.

General Motors Co.’s Cruise LLC unit will be allowed to test autonomous vehicles on public roads in San Francisco without a safety driver, joining Amazon.com Inc.-backed Zoox Inc. and a handful of other self-driving startups.
Cruise is permitted to operate five vehicles without a driver behind the wheel, a step up from approval it received five years ago that required the presence of a person to take control if needed, the California Department of Motor Vehicles said Thursday in a statement.
While some 60 companies have permission to conduct autonomous testing with a safety driver in California, Cruise becomes only the fifth allowed to test a truly driverless mode in the state.

Cruise is permitted to operate five vehicles without a driver behind the wheel, a step up from approval it received five years ago that required the presence of a person to take control if needed, the California Department of Motor Vehicles said Thursday in a statement.
While some 60 companies have permission to conduct autonomous testing with a safety driver in California, Cruise becomes only the fifth allowed to test a truly driverless mode in the state.

General Motors Co.’s Cruise LLC unit will be allowed to test autonomous vehicles on public roads in San Francisco without a safety driver, joining Amazon.com Inc.-backed Zoox Inc. and a handful of other self-driving startups.
Cruise is permitted to operate five vehicles without a driver behind the wheel, a step up from approval it received five years ago that required the presence of a person to take control if needed, the California Department of Motor Vehicles said Thursday in a statement.
While some 60 companies have permission to conduct autonomous testing with a safety driver in California, Cruise becomes only the fifth allowed to test a truly driverless mode in the state.

General Motors Co.’s Cruise LLC unit will be allowed to test autonomous vehicles on public roads in San Francisco without a safety driver, joining Amazon.com Inc.-backed Zoox Inc. and a handful of other self-driving startups.
Cruise is permitted to operate five vehicles without a driver behind the wheel, a step up from approval it received five years ago that required the presence of a person to take control if needed, the California Department of Motor Vehicles said Thursday in a statement.
While some 60 companies have permission to conduct autonomous testing with a safety driver in California, Cruise becomes only the fifth allowed to test a truly driverless mode in the state.

General Motors Co.’s Cruise LLC unit will be allowed to test autonomous vehicles on public roads in San Francisco without a safety driver, joining Amazon.com Inc.-backed Zoox Inc. and a handful of other self-driving startups.
Cruise is permitted to operate five vehicles without a driver behind the wheel, a step up from approval it received five years ago that required the presence of a person to take control if needed, the California Department of Motor Vehicles said Thursday in a statement.
While some 60 companies have permission to conduct autonomous testing with a safety driver in California, Cruise becomes only the fifth allowed to test a truly driverless mode in the state. Others in that small group include Alphabet Inc. unit Waymo LLC, Nuro Inc., AutoX Technologies and Zoox -- which received its permit last month.",howard_98305575,October 22

General Motors Co.’s Cruise LLC unit will be allowed to test autonomous vehicles on public roads in San Francisco without a safety driver, joining Amazon.com Inc.-backed Zoox Inc. and a handful of other self-driving startups.
Cruise is permitted to operate five vehicles without a driver behind the wheel, a step up from approval it received five years ago that required the presence of a person to take control if needed, the California Department of Motor Vehicles said Thursday in a statement.
While some 60 companies have permission to conduct autonomous testing with a safety driver in California, Cruise becomes only the fifth allowed to test a truly driverless mode in the state.

General Motors Co.’s Cruise LLC unit will be allowed to test autonomous vehicles on public roads in San Francisco without a safety driver, joining Amazon.com Inc.-backed Zoox Inc. and a handful of other self-driving startups.
Cruise is permitted to operate five vehicles without a driver behind the wheel, a step up from approval it received five years ago that required the presence of a person to take control if needed, the California Department of Motor Vehicles said Thursday in a statement.
While some 60 companies have permission to conduct autonomous testing with a safety driver in California, Cruise becomes only the fifth allowed to test a truly driverless mode in the state.

General Motors Co.’s Cruise LLC unit will be allowed to test autonomous vehicles on public roads in San Francisco without a safety driver, joining Amazon.com Inc.-backed Zoox Inc. and a handful of other self-driving startups.
Cruise is permitted to operate five vehicles without a driver behind the wheel, a step up from approval it received five years ago that required the presence of a person to take control if needed, the California Department of Motor Vehicles said Thursday in a statement.
While some 60 companies have permission to conduct autonomous testing with a safety driver in California, Cruise becomes only the fifth allowed to test a truly driverless mode in the state.

Cruise is permitted to operate five vehicles without a driver behind the wheel, a step up from approval it received five years ago that required the presence of a person to take control if needed, the California Department of Motor Vehicles said Thursday in a statement.
While some 60 companies have permission to conduct autonomous testing with a safety driver in California, Cruise becomes only the fifth allowed to test a truly driverless mode in the state. Others in that small group include Alphabet Inc. unit Waymo LLC, Nuro Inc., AutoX Technologies and Zoox -- which received its permit last month.",howard_98305575,October 22

General Motors Co.’s Cruise LLC unit will be allowed to test autonomous vehicles on public roads in San Francisco without a safety driver, joining Amazon.com Inc.-backed Zoox Inc. and a handful of other self-driving startups.
Cruise is permitted to operate five vehicles without a driver behind the wheel, a step up from approval it received five years ago that required the presence of a person to take control if needed, the California Department of Motor Vehicles said Thursday in a statement.
While some 60 companies have permission to conduct autonomous testing with a safety driver in California, Cruise becomes only the fifth allowed to test a truly driverless mode in the state.

General Motors Co.’s Cruise LLC unit will be allowed to test autonomous vehicles on public roads in San Francisco without a safety driver, joining Amazon.com Inc.-backed Zoox Inc. and a handful of other self-driving startups.
Cruise is permitted to operate five vehicles without a driver behind the wheel, a step up from approval it received five years ago that required the presence of a person to take control if needed, the California Department of Motor Vehicles said Thursday in a statement.
While some 60 companies have permission to conduct autonomous testing with a safety driver in California, Cruise becomes only the fifth allowed to test a truly driverless mode in the state.

General Motors Co.’s Cruise LLC unit will be allowed to test autonomous vehicles on public roads in San Francisco without a safety driver, joining Amazon.com Inc.-backed Zoox Inc. and a handful of other self-driving startups.
Cruise is permitted to operate five vehicles without a driver behind the wheel, a step up from approval it received five years ago that required the presence of a person to take control if needed, the California Department of Motor Vehicles said Thursday in a statement.
While some 60 companies have permission to conduct autonomous testing with a safety driver in California, Cruise becomes only the fifth allowed to test a truly driverless mode in the state.

Cruise is permitted to operate five vehicles without a driver behind the wheel, a step up from approval it received five years ago that required the presence of a person to take control if needed, the California Department of Motor Vehicles said Thursday in a statement.
While some 60 companies have permission to conduct autonomous testing with a safety driver in California, Cruise becomes only the fifth allowed to test a truly driverless mode in the state. Others in that small group include Alphabet Inc. unit Waymo LLC, Nuro Inc., AutoX Technologies and Zoox -- which received its permit last month.",howard_98305575,October 22

Trunk frozen suggestion / hint,So today I went to open the trunk after a quick heavy rain to below freezing transition. I immediately felt some resistance to opening the trunk lid and figured I would leave it till it got warmer. Once it warmed up and I opened the trunk it was obvious that the small rubber lip that surrounds the rear glass was wet and had frozen to the trunk. Not sure but I believe if I forced it when frozen it might have ripped the rubber. I would strongly suggest some silicone on that rubber.,Joe M,December 7

Wheel split open on 2019 model 3 while driving - NO pothole or curb hit - Tesla WONT cover it!!,"While driving my 2019 model 3 on a newly paved road (ie no potholes or debris) the front left wheel split apart with no warning or provocation.

Wheel split open on 2019 model 3 while driving - NO pothole or curb hit - Tesla WONT cover it!!,"While driving my 2019 model 3 on a newly paved road (ie no potholes or debris) the front left wheel split apart with no warning or provocation.

Autopilot unable to center in lane for 10 minutes after supercharging,"On 2020.44.15 and drove cross country when I noticed odd behavior after leaving each supercharging station. If I put the car into AP on the highway, the car would drift to the left of the lane and be dangerously far over. So far that the left tires were thumping over the aural bumps on the lane lines. Had to revert to simple speed control and wait for about 10 minutes or so of highway driving before I could reengage AP and expect it to hold the lane. 
I would see the car on the left and the blue Nav on AP line curving to the center but the car would hug the left and not go where the line showed it wanted to be. 
This phenomenon was consistent on every SC stop for at least the last four days of the drive. 
Anyone else experiencing this? Is it corrected in a later SW update or is this potentially a hardware failure? M 3 LR picked up late Jan 2020.

""Atlanta"" is spread out. Technically, we are travelling between Sandy Springs, Acworth, Marietta, Atlanta proper, and occasionally, Fairburn and Peachtree City. Ideally, we do it without superchargers, but occasionally, particularly in winter, we just can't. If my father in law has to go to the VA, that means hubby leaves the house, drives 35 miles to get him, 50 down to the VA, 50 back, and 35 home -- and that's just for the appointment. It doesn't include any additional grocery stops, nor does it include any parked losses. In the winter, that can be a challenge to do with the heater and highway speeds.

Waypoints,"Funny thing about multiple waypoints.. There's this problem in CS, called the ""Traveling Salesman"" problem, that has been unusually difficult to solve. That is, given a map, multiple random points on it, and a task to find the minimum time to hit all those points, it's a lot harder than one would think. I hope some CS major chimes in, but I think it's one of those (obtuse) NP-complete kind of problems.
Back in days of yore, when Microsoft was Trying To Compete In All Things, Microsoft Maps was a thing. The SO and I planned a coast-to-coast round trip with the tool. One gives it a list of places, in no particular order, and it puts up a route, including breaks with sleep times, and so on. First pass was counterclockwise; we changed it to clockwise and planned our vacation.
But that first crunch when it took all these places we wanted to go took 5-10 minutes, if memory serves.
So, it's one thing to put in one additional stop, like the way Waze does it (and Waze limits it to one additional stop), or one puts in N stops with Google Maps, but defines which stop is in what order; it's another if the number of stops is N and the order of the stops isn't defined.
It'll be interesting to see what the implementation looks like.",Tronguy,December 7
Waypoints,"I would argue that most people would be using waypoints with the knowledge of what general order the stops will be in, and then maybe tweaking a couple things after seeing the route. I would guess a very small subset of people would attempt to toss a bunch of random points in the air and want the system to figure out the best order of travel. Delivery people would be that general subset and those tools already exist.
At work we have a VBA program in excel that basically does what you are talking about for a completely different set/type of data and it can take a few minutes to run.

Waypoints,...had a list of superchargers and can import a list...26(max allowed) random superchargers in CA took 26 seconds to calculate shortest time when allowing reordering of the stops.,derotam,December 7
Waypoints,"Multiple waypoints aren't a traveling salesman problem because they are already ordered. All you have to figure out is the route from A->B and then from B->C and then C->D, it's the same routing problem three times over. What multiple waypoints gives you is the ability to figure out when you need to charge for the whole trip. With a single waypoint it's not possible for the computer to figure out the charging problem. If you can make it from A->B without charging it' won't tell you to charge, if then the B->C portion of the trip can also be done without charging but then there is a final section C->D that does require a charge but there is no charging on that section of the route, the nearest charging is back at B which you can't reach either. I've given this real life example before but I'll repeat it here. Before covid a regular trip for us was to the Berkshires. Our first destination was Great Barrington which is 150 miles. There are now two Superchargers near there, one in Lee and a new one in Great Barrington. Our next destination is North Adams which is about 50 miles away, no charging needed to get there either. However to get home we have to travel 130 miles on Route 2 which has no Superchargers. The total trip is 330 miles which is beyond the range of the car. As long as we charge at our first destination, either at Lee or Great Barrington, there is no problem but if we didn't charge there we would be SOL. I know to do this because I've looked at the whole route, but the car can't calculate the charging stops because it knows nothing about the whole trip. With multiple waypoints we could put in Great Barrington, North Adams, Home and it would be able to solve the charging problem just like a person.",bjrosen,December 7

Model 3 upcoming arrival,"Ignore @mrburke, for one thing. Yeah, we get the occasional glass cracked front windshield around here, but that's true for any automobile, he's just raising FUD.
As far as charging: Figuring how how to charge your car will be a priority.
Simplest is if you've got 120 VAC; but you'll get a pretty slow charge rate, 4-5 MoCpH (Miles of Charge per Hour). Better is if you have or can have put in a 240 VAC socket. With a NEMA14-50, you can get around 32 MoCpH; other 240 sockets will give you that or somewhat less, depending upon type. You may need to get the correct adapter for the Mobile Connector that comes with the car, they're (I think) $25 a pop over at Tesla.
If you're getting a LR or P variant of the car, it can charge at 48A, for about 45 MoCpH. (SR/SR+ don't have the extra charger built into the car, so they're limited to 32A/32 MoCpH.)
The only known way to get that extra oomph, assuming you're so inclined, is to get a Level 2 connector with that current level of capability. There are ones out there that can do the 48A trick, but they cost more than Tesla's $500 entry into the party. And, in either case, you'd still need to hire an electrician to put in the (heavy) wire and 60A breaker, assuming your electrical panel has the capacity.
Couple of minor points. The TWC (Tesla Wall Connector) is somewhat handy, in that one can leave the TMC (Tesla Mobile Connector) in the trunk, where it belongs, and hook up/remove the TWC when you park the car and/or leave. In other words, it's clean, handy, and doesn't get in the way.
Lots of people use the TMC; I'd halfway suggest you might want an _extra_ one to leave in the garage all the time and leave the one that you get with the car, in the car, so you don't mistakenly get caught out.
Other than all the charging bit: There are checklists out there for new cars and, really, the Tesla is no different in that regard. Verify that all the windows work, power seats work, glovebox opens/shuts, headlights/tailights/turn signals all work, look for scratches, cracked glass, what-all. Look in all the corners and make sure there's nothing missing; in particular, look at trim and make sure it's all popped correctly into position. You get the idea.",Tronguy,December 7

Never getting Tesla again! No roadside help!,"I’ve had my car less than 1 year, and got a flat. No tire in the car to change it myself.

No other option. I explained that I wasn’t home, I am a surgeon on call for the hospital and had to get there ASAP, and they just gave me attitude on the phone and wouldn’t offer any other help. 
I went to pep boys hoping to plug it to hold over until the next day, and they said Tesla makes tires with a strange lining so they can’t patch it. 
I was able to get it to hold air until I drove it home where I could get a family member to bring me their car to borrow. So then I submit a new request, and since I didn’t text back to them in a 5-10 min time they canceled the request and I had to start again. Then they weren’t getting my responses even though my phone was showing it went through, so they were going to try to cancel it again. I eventually got it scheduled.

""""Most of the time"" and ""Generally speaking"" are NOT the same as your earlier claim of ""In all cases AWD beats FWD beats RWD"". Keep changing your story so you can eventually say something that is correct and meaningful by accident.

Exhibit 1:
When I plug my CCS-equipped Tesla into a non-Tesla CCS charger, I can see my exact battery percentage in the display of the charger. The charger can't know this without communication. It will of course know the actual voltage of my battery, but since battery chemistry is different from car to car, that voltage can't be used to give an exact percentage for an unknown car.
So if this happens wirelessly between cars and chargers of different brands, there would need to be a standard covering this communication. Can you point to such a standard? Can you explain how the charger knows which car to communicate with when there are two charge cables on the same charger, and car position relative to the charger is random?
Exhibit 2:
Here in Europe, Tesla's (weak) excuse for not allowing other CCS cars to charge on Tesla Superchargers is: Other cars have not implemented VIN communication via CCS, so we can't know the identity of that car. This pretty much tells us that Tesla communicates the VIN through CCS.
It is possible that there is no communication in the plug used by Tesla in the US. I wouldn't know anything about that. But this thread doesn't seem to be limited to the US anyway.",AllanO,December 5

And it also untrue as VW as Ford and VW are both talking of similar communication between car and charger for MachE and ID4's in US.

But if you are worried about others knowing your VIN, are you also doing something to prevent them from looking through your windshield and seeing it?
And if you are worried about others knowing your charge percentage, are you also doing something to cover up the screen in your car so they can't see it there?
I would only be worried if someone pointed out that the communication protocol supports pulling any data from the car, and not just the data needed for negotiating a charging session. Do you have any indication of this being the case?",AllanO,December 5

Exhibit 1:
When I plug my CCS-equipped Tesla into a non-Tesla CCS charger, I can see my exact battery percentage in the display of the charger. The charger can't know this without communication. It will of course know the actual voltage of my battery, but since battery chemistry is different from car to car, that voltage can't be used to give an exact percentage for an unknown car.
So if this happens wirelessly between cars and chargers of different brands, there would need to be a standard covering this communication. Can you point to such a standard? Can you explain how the charger knows which car to communicate with when there are two charge cables on the same charger, and car position relative to the charger is random?
Exhibit 2:
Here in Europe, Tesla's (weak) excuse for not allowing other CCS cars to charge on Tesla Superchargers is: Other cars have not implemented VIN communication via CCS, so we can't know the identity of that car. This pretty much tells us that Tesla communicates the VIN through CCS.
It is possible that there is no communication in the plug used by Tesla in the US. I wouldn't know anything about that. But this thread doesn't seem to be limited to the US anyway.",AllanO,December 5

Highway 71 going west into Bastrop, Texas has a red light intersection in a 75 mph zone. Bit of an oversight, I'd say. Last time I passed through, I looked behind me - no cars - looked toward the intersection - no cars.

It would be helpful if you could get specifics about what he did so others can use the correct terminology. If someone else has the problem and calls in and says to fix my problem you need to ""Reset some things"" and ""Clean some Cache"" probably will not get very far.

For me the only time I was able to get the right answers was using Tesla's chat feature. They were able to see that the car still showed in Tesla's possession from a previous service ticket done 1 yr earlier. My local service center called me and she was able to go into each appointment and figure out which one was glitching and reopen and close the ticket. After that its been fine.

It would be helpful if you could get specifics about what he did so others can use the correct terminology. If someone else has the problem and calls in and says to fix my problem you need to ""Reset some things"" and ""Clean some Cache"" probably will not get very far.

For me the only time I was able to get the right answers was using Tesla's chat feature. They were able to see that the car still showed in Tesla's possession from a previous service ticket done 1 yr earlier. My local service center called me and she was able to go into each appointment and figure out which one was glitching and reopen and close the ticket. After that its been fine. If your still having issues let me know as I did ask for a case number while they were working mine. Maybe they can cross reference the notes they took.",stgermain.jake_98451790,October 1

Is it safe to use portable charger daily at home?,"So, a YMMV statement. Current NEC code, at least as implemented in NJ where I live, requires that an outlet in the garage have its own breaker. Nominal breaker value is 15A, and that gives you 12A @125 VAC on your mobile connector. Hence, the comments about ""watch out about additional loads"" is valid, but only if the additional load is plugged into the same duplex outlet. So, running your favorite weed-whacker, hedge trimmer, or what-have-you on the same outlet as the mobile connector, when said mobile connector is running, is probably not a great idea.
Note that this, ""on its own breaker"" is not exactly a new thing. In the kitchen, it's kind of required that major appliances like built-in microwaves, refrigerators, and garbage disposals be likewise on their own breakers. 
If you're feeling ambitious, your breaker panel is not already maxed out, and, in particular, if your panel is in the garage (making things easier), doing any of the following will make your charging life easier:
1. With an electrician's help, upgrading the garage 120 VAC socket to 20A means that you can charge at 16A rather than 12A. This would mean making sure the wire gauge supports the higher current, the socket has that additional right-angle slot for the blade, the breaker gets changed to 20A rather than 15, and you get the $30 adapter for NEMA5-20; but, then, instead of 4-5 miles of charge per hour, you'll get 25% faster, 5-6 miles of charge per hour.
2. If your breaker panel isn't maxed out, adding a duplex breaker to get you 240 VAC, a (hopefully short) length of the right gauge wire, a NEMA14-50 socket, and the NEMA14-50 adapter for the mobile connector, will give you 32A at 240 VAC, and a charge rate of around 32 Miles of Charge per Hour.

Wall Connector only outputting 4kw,"@HAL,
3 phase is fairly common in Europe and the UK. 
@Bazzalonius,
Most likely, there's a problem in your wiring. If the charging circuitry inside your car senses a voltage drop under load, it drops the charging current accordingly. Your wiring may not be large enough to handle the full load. Recommend you try reducing the charging current and have an electrician check out your wiring for the full 11 kW.",Earl and Nagin 08 RDS 359,December 6

He has a wall charger. Wall chargers do not have outlets. 
However I do recommend installing a nema 14-50 and then put a 14-50 plug on the wall charger. This way if the wall charger breaks you can use the mobile charger until it gets fixed. The wall charger is 3 wire and a 14-50 is 4 wire so if you want the ability to add a 14-50 plug you need to install 4 wire.

Wall Connector only outputting 4kw,"@HAL2001: No biggie, but:
Max charge rate is 80% of the breaker rating in the panel, at least according to the US National Electric Code.
M3 max charge rate on 240 is 48A; that can be achieved with a TWC connected to a 60A breaker. If one has the kind of TWC that is connected to a NEMA14-50, max charge rate is 80% of 50A, or 45A.
A TWC can be set up to work with a 100A rated circuit, useable on certain Model S's, I believe.

Model 3 2020 Battery 17 miles battery degradation,"That seems normal to me. I have a 9/2019 LR AWD and get about the same estimated range. It increased a few miles this summer (warmer) and after some road trips, but is back to about 292 at 100%. Some will say “estimated range is not an indicator of degradation” because pack measurement has inherent variation. I think it’s certainly correlated to degradation though.
Bottom line is all batteries degrade over time. Luckily the warranty lasts 8 years. 
It doesn’t affect how I use my car at all. Only time it might is for really long road trips in winter. For those I’ll take our Audi Q5 anyway as I like to drive fast and far between stops.",Twochewy,December 4

Biden proposes installing 500k charging stations (cords as the article states),"The original wording of the article I read:
Bloomberg News
In a bid to fight climate change and build a stronger, greener economy, Joe Biden is starting with plugs.
Specifically, the president elect has a plan to install 500,000 electric vehicle charging cords by 2030, roughly a five-fold increase in the nation’s EV infrastructure that could cost more than $5 billion.
The 500,000-unit pledge was part of Biden’s platform when he was running for the job but largely overlooked in a grinding campaign dominated by the pandemic. Now, the industry hopes he’ll stick with it. But it is a wildly ambitious strategy to overcome one of the biggest hurdles facing EVs: Would-be drivers fear they won’t have enough places to charge up. The infrastructure milestone would cover 57% of the charging that U.S. vehicles will need by 2030 and could spark the sale of some 25 million electric cars and trucks, according to forecasts by BloombergNEF.
“It’s spot-on with what the market needs,” said Cathy Zoi, chief executive officer of EVgo, one of the country’s largest charging networks. “The sweet spot is to actually accelerate the electrification of our transportation, and this can bring that forward by three to five years.” (Biden’s transition team declined to comment on the president elect’s stated plans.) Right now, there are about 90,000 public charging plugs at 28,000 U.S. stations, according to the latest Energy Department tally. However, one in five of those is exclusive to Tesla; of the remainder, only one in 10 tops a car up quickly enough to be useful on a road trip. Most public charging options are still relatively slow_useful for drivers idling at work, for example, or grinding through a long grocery hunt.
Nevertheless, U.S. charging infrastructure is arguably a little ahead of the EV market. At the moment, there are about 20 U.S. electric vehicles for every public plug_the ideal ratio, according to research from BloombergNEF, is about 40 to 50. At that rate, Biden’s charging push would cover 25 million electric vehicles, roughly 9% of the current U.S. vehicle fleet.
For automakers, the policy push provides confidence to maintain or accelerate electric vehicle rollouts.",gmr6415,December 3

Bloomberg News
In a bid to fight climate change and build a stronger, greener economy, Joe Biden is starting with plugs.
Specifically, the president elect has a plan to install 500,000 electric vehicle charging cords by 2030, roughly a five-fold increase in the nation’s EV infrastructure that could cost more than $5 billion.
The 500,000-unit pledge was part of Biden’s platform when he was running for the job but largely overlooked in a grinding campaign dominated by the pandemic. Now, the industry hopes he’ll stick with it. But it is a wildly ambitious strategy to overcome one of the biggest hurdles facing EVs: Would-be drivers fear they won’t have enough places to charge up. The infrastructure milestone would cover 57% of the charging that U.S. vehicles will need by 2030 and could spark the sale of some 25 million electric cars and trucks, according to forecasts by BloombergNEF.
“It’s spot-on with what the market needs,” said Cathy Zoi, chief executive officer of EVgo, one of the country’s largest charging networks. “The sweet spot is to actually accelerate the electrification of our transportation, and this can bring that forward by three to five years.” (Biden’s transition team declined to comment on the president elect’s stated plans.) Right now, there are about 90,000 public charging plugs at 28,000 U.S. stations, according to the latest Energy Department tally. However, one in five of those is exclusive to Tesla; of the remainder, only one in 10 tops a car up quickly enough to be useful on a road trip. Most public charging options are still relatively slow_useful for drivers idling at work, for example, or grinding through a long grocery hunt.
Nevertheless, U.S. charging infrastructure is arguably a little ahead of the EV market. At the moment, there are about 20 U.S. electric vehicles for every public plug_the ideal ratio, according to research from BloombergNEF, is about 40 to 50. At that rate, Biden’s charging push would cover 25 million electric vehicles, roughly 9% of the current U.S. vehicle fleet.
For automakers, the policy push provides confidence to maintain or accelerate electric vehicle rollouts.",gmr6415,December 3

Biden proposes installing 500k charging stations (cords as the article states),"The original wording of the article I read:
Bloomberg News
In a bid to fight climate change and build a stronger, greener economy, Joe Biden is starting with plugs.
Specifically, the president elect has a plan to install 500,000 electric vehicle charging cords by 2030, roughly a five-fold increase in the nation’s EV infrastructure that could cost more than $5 billion.
The 500,000-unit pledge was part of Biden’s platform when he was running for the job but largely overlooked in a grinding campaign dominated by the pandemic. Now, the industry hopes he’ll stick with it. But it is a wildly ambitious strategy to overcome one of the biggest hurdles facing EVs: Would-be drivers fear they won’t have enough places to charge up. The infrastructure milestone would cover 57% of the charging that U.S. vehicles will need by 2030 and could spark the sale of some 25 million electric cars and trucks, according to forecasts by BloombergNEF.
“It’s spot-on with what the market needs,” said Cathy Zoi, chief executive officer of EVgo, one of the country’s largest charging networks. “The sweet spot is to actually accelerate the electrification of our transportation, and this can bring that forward by three to five years.” (Biden’s transition team declined to comment on the president elect’s stated plans.) Right now, there are about 90,000 public charging plugs at 28,000 U.S. stations, according to the latest Energy Department tally. However, one in five of those is exclusive to Tesla; of the remainder, only one in 10 tops a car up quickly enough to be useful on a road trip. Most public charging options are still relatively slow_useful for drivers idling at work, for example, or grinding through a long grocery hunt.
Nevertheless, U.S. charging infrastructure is arguably a little ahead of the EV market. At the moment, there are about 20 U.S. electric vehicles for every public plug_the ideal ratio, according to research from BloombergNEF, is about 40 to 50. At that rate, Biden’s charging push would cover 25 million electric vehicles, roughly 9% of the current U.S. vehicle fleet.
For automakers, the policy push provides confidence to maintain or accelerate electric vehicle rollouts.",gmr6415,December 3

Driving Tips to Maximize Range (manual),"I hope this helps new owners who missed manual or simply ignored it.
Driving Tips to Maximize Range 
You can maximize your driving range using the same driving habits you use to conserve fuel in a gasoline-powered vehicle. In addition to driving habits, energy consumption depends on environmental conditions (such as exceptionally cold or hot weather and driving on roads with steep hills).
To achieve maximum range: 
• Slow down your driving and avoid frequent and rapid acceleration. Consider using Chill Mode (see Controls on page 136) and Speed Assist (see Speed Assist on page 134) to assist in controlling your acceleration and speed. 
• If safe to do so, modulate the accelerator pedal instead of using the brake pedal when gradually slowing down. Whenever Model 3 is moving and you are not pressing the accelerator pedal, regenerative braking slows down Model 3 and feeds surplus energy back to the Battery (see Regenerative Braking on page 69).
• Set Stopping Mode to HOLD to gain the benefit of regenerative braking at low driving speeds (see Stopping Mode on page 70).
• Keep tires at the recommended inflation pressures (see Tire Care and Maintenance on page 188), ensure tire alignment is within specification, and tires are rotated when needed. Rotating tires will reduce uneven tread wear, increasing your vehicle's efficiency (see Maintenance Schedule on page 186).
• Lighten your load by removing any unnecessary cargo. 
• Fully raise all windows. 
• Limit the use of resources such as heating, lights, and air conditioning. Using seat heaters to keep warm is more efficient than heating the cabin using climate controls. 
• Precondition the vehicle while it is plugged in to ensure the cabin is at a comfortable temperature and windows are defrosted (if needed) before your drive. Use the mobile app to precondition your vehicle by touching Climate > Turn On Climate and customizing your preferences (see Mobile App on page 174). 
• Features such as Sentry Mode, Headlights After Exit, and Cabin Overheat Protection can impact range. Disable features that are not needed. 
• To prevent an excessive amount of energy consumption while the vehicle is idle, keep the vehicle plugged in when not in use.
• Minimize the use of DC chargers (such as superchargers) for optimal Battery health. The power meter on the touchscreen and the Energy app (see Energy App on page 80) provides feedback on energy usage. With this feedback, you can become familiar with how driving habits and environmental conditions impact how much energy Model 3 is using. 
Factors Affecting Energy Consumption Several factors can affect your vehicle's rate of energy consumption, including:
• Uphill travel: Driving uphill requires more energy and depletes range at a faster rate. However, driving downhill allows your vehicle to regain a portion of its expended energy through regenerative braking (see Regenerative Braking on page 69).
• Customized settings: Energy is consumed by accessories like lights, heating and cooling, media player, Sentry Mode, etc. 
• Short trips: It takes energy to bring the cabin and Battery to a specified temperature when starting the vehicle. You may see a higher average consumption when the vehicle is used for very short trips while climate controls are enabled. 
• Temperature and weather conditions: In colder weather, precondition the vehicle before driving (see Cold Weather Best Practices on page 86).",WW_icefree,October 1

One reason most Tesla owners find it unnecessary to turn off the heater is the range is so much more.

The heater automatically reduces power once the cabin gets to temperature. So a 50% limit on heating like the VW uses only serves to slow the cabin heating up. Keep in mind Tesla uses the waste heat of the motor and batteries to heat the cabin. The VW has a simple resistive heater. If you were to slow your heating in the Tesla, you may waste energy in the Tesla, as the excess heat is just sent to the radiator. 
To be fair, there are so many variables, such as outside temperature, inside desired temperature, the speed you are traveling (higher speeds cause more heat in the motor and batteries), the battery temperature at the start of the trip, and I'm sure a few other factors. So there could be conditions where heating the cabin quickly uses more energy than delaying the cabin heating up. My guess is fast cabin heating vs. slow cabin heating costs about 1/2 mile of range on a trip in the worst conditions. In better conditions, it may cost nothing in range.

Driving Tips to Maximize Range (manual),"I recently figured out an easy strategy for improving highway range. It’s based on the fact that regenerative breaking is not 100% efficient so you don’t get back as much kinetic energy as you put in via breaking. In other words coasting downhill and letting the car accelerate a bit is better than using regenerative breaking to try to recapture the energy.
Here’s what I tried:
Say you want to go about 70 mph (traffic permitting):
- When transitioning from uphill to downhill slowly increase speed setting to 71 (higher if a steep hill and you can safely)
- When transitioning from downhill to uphill slowly decrease speed setting to 69
Note: Car accelerates less aggressively if you change speed by 1 mph and wait until it gets to that speed before increasing again.

Driving Tips to Maximize Range 
You can maximize your driving range using the same driving habits you use to conserve fuel in a gasoline-powered vehicle. In addition to driving habits, energy consumption depends on environmental conditions (such as exceptionally cold or hot weather and driving on roads with steep hills).
To achieve maximum range: 
• Slow down your driving and avoid frequent and rapid acceleration. Consider using Chill Mode (see Controls on page 136) and Speed Assist (see Speed Assist on page 134) to assist in controlling your acceleration and speed. 
• If safe to do so, modulate the accelerator pedal instead of using the brake pedal when gradually slowing down. Whenever Model 3 is moving and you are not pressing the accelerator pedal, regenerative braking slows down Model 3 and feeds surplus energy back to the Battery (see Regenerative Braking on page 69).
• Set Stopping Mode to HOLD to gain the benefit of regenerative braking at low driving speeds (see Stopping Mode on page 70).
• Keep tires at the recommended inflation pressures (see Tire Care and Maintenance on page 188), ensure tire alignment is within specification, and tires are rotated when needed. Rotating tires will reduce uneven tread wear, increasing your vehicle's efficiency (see Maintenance Schedule on page 186).
• Lighten your load by removing any unnecessary cargo. 
• Fully raise all windows. 
• Limit the use of resources such as heating, lights, and air conditioning. Using seat heaters to keep warm is more efficient than heating the cabin using climate controls. 
• Precondition the vehicle while it is plugged in to ensure the cabin is at a comfortable temperature and windows are defrosted (if needed) before your drive. Use the mobile app to precondition your vehicle by touching Climate > Turn On Climate and customizing your preferences (see Mobile App on page 174). 
• Features such as Sentry Mode, Headlights After Exit, and Cabin Overheat Protection can impact range. Disable features that are not needed. 
• To prevent an excessive amount of energy consumption while the vehicle is idle, keep the vehicle plugged in when not in use.
• Minimize the use of DC chargers (such as superchargers) for optimal Battery health. The power meter on the touchscreen and the Energy app (see Energy App on page 80) provides feedback on energy usage. With this feedback, you can become familiar with how driving habits and environmental conditions impact how much energy Model 3 is using. 
Factors Affecting Energy Consumption Several factors can affect your vehicle's rate of energy consumption, including:
• Uphill travel: Driving uphill requires more energy and depletes range at a faster rate. However, driving downhill allows your vehicle to regain a portion of its expended energy through regenerative braking (see Regenerative Braking on page 69).
• Customized settings: Energy is consumed by accessories like lights, heating and cooling, media player, Sentry Mode, etc. 
• Short trips: It takes energy to bring the cabin and Battery to a specified temperature when starting the vehicle. You may see a higher average consumption when the vehicle is used for very short trips while climate controls are enabled. 
• Temperature and weather conditions: In colder weather, precondition the vehicle before driving (see Cold Weather Best Practices on page 86).",WW_icefree,October 1

Enjoy being comfortable - the idea is not to have any compromises over an ICE car.
Yes, but not only that. Sometimes aggressive heating is just a waste of energy. OK, in Teslas we might have a lot of energy accumulated, but waste it for what ?
And there is another issue - vw doesn't switch off heating completely, juts reduces it by IDK - 50 - 70 %. There still is a airflow, which is important. Your advice to kill fan is only solution, but its not the best",Heliogabals,October 7
Driving Tips to Maximize Range (manual),"@Heliogabals - I can understand in a lower-end car some owners want to be very frugal. With a premium car like the Model 3, I'd expect most want to be comfortable while they drive. Heating for comfort isn't a waste of energy. For EVs to be a success, most potential owners are not willing to compromise comfort over what they are used to.
The heater automatically reduces power once the cabin gets to temperature. So a 50% limit on heating like the VW uses only serves to slow the cabin heating up. Keep in mind Tesla uses the waste heat of the motor and batteries to heat the cabin. The VW has a simple resistive heater. If you were to slow your heating in the Tesla, you may waste energy in the Tesla, as the excess heat is just sent to the radiator. 
To be fair, there are so many variables, such as outside temperature, inside desired temperature, the speed you are traveling (higher speeds cause more heat in the motor and batteries), the battery temperature at the start of the trip, and I'm sure a few other factors. So there could be conditions where heating the cabin quickly uses more energy than delaying the cabin heating up. My guess is fast cabin heating vs. slow cabin heating costs about 1/2 mile of range on a trip in the worst conditions. In better conditions, it may cost nothing in range.
Now you will have range loss on any EV to maintain the cabin heat, but Tesla's design is still more efficient than VWs. In the VW, I can see the concern owners have with the design they choose and the limited range.",TeslaTap.com,October 7
Driving Tips to Maximize Range (manual),"I recently figured out an easy strategy for improving highway range. It’s based on the fact that regenerative breaking is not 100% efficient so you don’t get back as much kinetic energy as you put in via breaking. In other words coasting downhill and letting the car accelerate a bit is better than using regenerative breaking to try to recapture the energy.
Here’s what I tried:
Say you want to go about 70 mph (traffic permitting):
- When transitioning from uphill to downhill slowly increase speed setting to 71 (higher if a steep hill and you can safely)
- When transitioning from downhill to uphill slowly decrease speed setting to 69
Note: Car accelerates less aggressively if you change speed by 1 mph and wait until it gets to that speed before increasing again.
I expect that increasing the spread (68-72) would be even better but would likely annoy other drivers.",kurtjwagner_98575232,October 9

Charging Speed..Which Is Ideal For Longevity of Battery?,So my LR RWD Model 3 HWPC is set up to charge at 48 amps and typically will charge at 47 miles of range per hour.

Charging Speed..Which Is Ideal For Longevity of Battery?,"I agree with previous posters; assuming you are charging up to the same state of charge, there would likely be an imperceptible difference in battery degradation between charging at 32 versus 48 amps at 240 volts.
What Earl and Nagin posted is correct; the primary factor in what we can do to preserve our battery is setting the state of charge appropriately. Regardless of the state of charge, as the original postered stated, frequent Supercharging can also have a negative effect on battery life.
Unrelated to battery degradation, I also agree with kevin_rf that there are significant differences in charging efficiency between 120 volt charging vs. 240 volt charging vs. Supercharging. According to a Car and Driver article. Charging at 120 v can be as low as 58% efficient. Using a Wall Connector is about 94% efficient, and using a Supercharger can be between 97 and 100% efficient. By efficient, they mean the percentage of the energy delivered by the charger that actually gets to the battery. 
Concerning the charging rate, it makes a big difference to how much you are actually paying to charge your car if you choose to trickle charge at 120 volts versus 240 volts. 
Assuming that your cost of electricity is 10 cents per kWh, with a Wall Connector, you would be paying $100 for 100 kWh to deliver 94 kWh of energy to the battery. That’s an effective rate of 10.64 cents per kWh. 
Trickle charging at 120 volts, you would be paying $100 for 100 kWh, but only 58 kWh of energy would get to the battery. That’s an effective rate of 17.24 cents per kWh delivered to the battery. So it costs 62% more to charge your car at 120 volts.

Charging Speed..Which Is Ideal For Longevity of Battery?,"@FISHEV, Once again you're using ancient data. The article you link to goes back to 2010, last updated in early 2018. It clearly has little to nothing to do with a vehicle that has a battery management system that controls the temperature of the pack while charging or a dedicated onboard charger specifically designed for the pack installed in the car.
""Simple Guidelines for Charging Lithium-based Batteries""
""Turn off the device or disconnect the load on charge to allow the current to drop unhindered during saturation. A parasitic load confuses the charger.""
""Charge at a moderate temperature. Do not charge at freezing temperature. (See BU-410: Charging at High and Low Temperatures)""
""Lithium-ion does not need to be fully charged; a partial charge is better.
Not all chargers apply a full topping charge and the battery may not be fully charged when the “ready” signal appears; a 100 percent charge on a fuel gauge may be a lie.""
""Discontinue using charger and/or battery if the battery gets excessively warm.""
""Apply some charge to an empty battery before storing (40–50 percent SoC is ideal). (See BU-702: How to Store Batteries.)""

Paying with CC for delivery?,"This brings up an interesting question - if you buy your car in California (or any state with a sales tax) and you later buy FSD, but order it from another state like Oregon that has no sales tax, are you charged sales tax on FSD?

Paying with CC for delivery?,"Sales tax for FSD would be applied depending on the state of registration not the state of the car's purchase. Sales taxes on the purchase of a car are dependent on the rules in that state. I live in MA which has a sales tax, next door in NH there is no sales tax. MA collects the tax as the registration fee, not at the point of purchase. I've bought most of my cars in NH, with those cars I had to take a check to the Registry when I registered the car. The Tesla was picked up in MA so Tesla was able to register the car for me including the registration fee which they transferred to the RMV as part of the process. If someone from NH bought a Tesla I'm pretty sure they wouldn't collect a sales tax because the car is going to be registered in NH. The rules for cars are different than the rules for anything else, if I buy a TV in Nashua and carry it out of the store then I don't pay a sales tax, if they deliver the TV then they do collect a sales tax. Theoretically I'm supposed to report that purchase on my income taxes and pay the tax then but I don't think anyone has done that once in the entire 400 year history of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.",bjrosen,December 6

Radio controls ain't what they used to be (literally),"Hello all! First time here. Be gentle. :)
I have searched the forum for info about a change that came with the most recent software upgrade but haven't found anything. It has to do with the way the scrollwheel is used to move from one preset to another when listening to AM/FM radio. Let's say I have 10 preset stations. The way I move from one preset to the next is by clicking the scrollwheel left/right. With each click the station moves up/down through the 10 presets. Previously, if I was on preset 10, and I clicked UP, I would get to preset 1. Basically, it was a loop. I could click left forever and it would just cycle through all of my presets. 
Since the software update, the loop is gone. If I am on preset 10, clicking right takes me to Spotify. If I am on preset 1, clicking left takes me to Spotify. Basically, if I am at the top or bottom of the list and don't turn around, I end up on Spotify. It doesn't even matter if I was on another source more recently (like listening from my phone or something like that). 
Once I'm on Spotify, clicking left/right does not take me back to the radio because that isn't part of the Spotify controls. I have to touch one of the radio presets to get back to radio.
I know this seems like a stupid gripe, but my last two cars had a similar control on the steering wheel, so I've been cycling through radio stations this way for over 20 years. It is going to be a very hard habit to break.
I guess the main thing I want to confirm is that this is the way it's supposed to be. Did others experience this change? Am I the only one who doesn't like it? I feel like most people stream music and would never have noticed this change. 
I guess part of the irritation is that it doesn't seem like an upgrade. Were people getting to the end of their radio presets and clicking the scrollwheel only to find that they were still on radio? Mad that they didn't automatically go to Spotify? Doubtful.",NoOneLikesMyCarButMe,December 6
Radio controls ain't what they used to be (literally),"Not a feature I've ever used, but hopefully, a future update will revert back. Note there is a new feature around .44 that you can disable audio sources you never use. Go to audio settings to change which sources appear. So if you never use Spotify (like me) you can remove it from the sources list.
Note that there are many software versions, if something changes, it's helpful to state the version like .44.25. Otherwise, no one can compare if something is the same on all cars, or when a change may have occurred. Usually, owners drop the ""year"" prefix as being somewhat obvious.",TeslaTap.com,December 6

That doesn't, of course, mean that your specific car doesn't have a noise issue due to a manufacturing defect or just a ""perfect storm"" of slight tolerance differences that create noise. 
For most wind noise issues specific to a particular vehicle, packing tape is your friend. Tape over every seam that might be causing noise until you find the one that has the biggest impact, and figure out why - perhaps the rubber seal near that seam is damaged or defective, whatever.

Not sure what was going on, but it consistently thought a truck two lanes over was in my way causing swerving into and out of the lante. It happened about 10 times over the course of the drive. Every time my car tried to move from far left lane of 3 lane interstate to the middle lane, it would swerve back thinking the truck in the far right lane was coming over. It's never been that bad.

Been having exactly the same phantom truck issues here in the UK for the past couple of months. I can reproduce it 100% of the time. Recalibrating the cameras does not fix it.

"Car disappeared in app ""There are no products linked to your Tesla account""","Seriously, what's with the questioning of individuals posting asking for help? I totally get that there could be individuals creating spam for god knows what reasons. But the OP is not spouting disgust or emotionally jilted and someone still calls this spam? He didn't shout or use caps to draw attention to the post. Too boot, it sounds like it's a known problem yet it's spam?
What kind of forum are we going to be if we discount what everyone posts? No one will want to return.",Jlomb436_98165589,July 2018

There was a Korean bot attack earlier today and many forum users ""bump"" threads to float them above the spam. I can see where you may have gotten that idea but you jumped to the wrong conclusion. Maybe ask a few questions before you go on a rant, eh?",Magic 8 Ball,July 2018

"Car disappeared in app ""There are no products linked to your Tesla account""","Same issue (“no product linked to your account” error) here but I can still use my ohone as a key to unlock/lock the car.

"Car disappeared in app ""There are no products linked to your Tesla account""",Did you pay your bill? I half expect if I miss a loan payment the thing will self drive home and repo itself...,kaiyankowski_98285664,July 2018
"Car disappeared in app ""There are no products linked to your Tesla account""","“Pay your bill?” question make sense to me.
I’m guessing that Tesla disabled access to my/your car until they finalize loan documents and it typically takes 2-3 days.
Have anyone paid cash experiencing the same issue?",thunderandcloud_98266153,July 2018
"Car disappeared in app ""There are no products linked to your Tesla account""","Having same issue. Called Tesla support, and service rep said it is a common issue and will resolve in 48-72 hours. Has to do with finalizing transfer of title and registration, and syncing with sales, etc. I paid cash but overpaid by $1 and suspect it'll take some time to reconcile. FWIW, my wife recalls the delivery guy warning us about the app being disabled, but I don't remember it at all. Must have been the euphoria. Having car delivered to your home, and being able to track it and have a Tesla rep walk you through all the feautres was a wonderful touch.",davepai_98144692,July 2018

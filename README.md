Students will learn the basics of analyzing social media data using the R programming language in this course. Students will use R for techniques such as sentiment analysis to gain behavioral insights from social media data utilizing various application programming interfaces (API) and take a critical approach to the benefits and limits of such analysis. Prerequisite: DATA 102.

## Final Project

The Marquee project for this class was a self-selected analysis of any data source. For mine, I chose to do a custom web scraping of the Tesla Model 3 User Forums and perform a sentiment analysis and a "Voice of Customer" analysis to identify top feature areas for investment or improvement.  You can find this project here:
